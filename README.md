# Welcome
This is a backup of every Bits and Bops riq to ever be uploaded to the Bits and Bops Discord

# So... how do I run these?

Well... here is a small tutorial. (I sure do love my archival-ness... huh)

# Linux

Running these on Linux is as easy as pie; just open the file location in steam (or navigate to the root of the itch.io folder)

Now, drag this Executable file (`Bits & Bops.x86_64`) onto an open terminal, starting a new session would be wise here.

Now, open up the folder where you downloaded the `.riq` mod, and drag it onto the terminal, the same one with your Bits and Bops binary.

Bam! Now it should open up.

If you would like it to open *automagically*... this may vary depending on the Window manager, from KDE to Cinnamon... etc. This is just a general guide.

Firstly, open up your mod folder, then `Right click > Open with > Other application...` Or something like that

Now, click the button that lets you choose the default custom path for a file, and navigate to your Bits and Bops folder.

Now, Select this as the default.

Everything should work now
