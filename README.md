# Welcome
This is a backup of every Bits and Bops riq to ever be uploaded to the Bits and Bops Discord

# So... how do I run these?

Well... here is a small tutorial. (I sure do love my archival-ness... huh)

# Linux

Running these on Linux is as easy as pie; just open the file location in steam (or navigate to the root of the itch.io folder)

Now, drag this Executable file (`Bits & Bops.x86_64`) onto an open terminal, starting a new session would be wise here.

Now, open up the folder where you downloaded the `.riq` mod, and drag it onto the terminal, the same one with your Bits and Bops binary.

Bam! Now it should open up.

If you would like it to open *automagically*... this may vary depending on the Window manager, from KDE to Cinnamon... etc. This is just a general guide.

Firstly, open up your mod folder, then `Right click > Open with > Other application...` Or something like that

Now, click the button that lets you choose the default custom path for a file, and navigate to your Bits and Bops folder.

Now, Select this as the default.

Everything should work now

# macOS

Sadly, due to how stubbourn macOS is, you cannot automagically set it up to open any .riq for bits and bops. Buuuuut!
You can put in some terminal-action, and get it running just like Linux.

1.) Go to Steam (skip for itch) and click the Cog icon (settings icon, click the Bits and Bops game in your steam library) and click Manage > Browse Local files

2.) Right-click your Bits and Bops.app and click Show package Contents (Fun fact! All .apps on macos are just folders, but fancy)

3.) Navigate into Contents

4.) Now, right-click onto the MacOS directory and click Open in new terminal

5.) Now, in the Finder window, navigate into the MacOS folder, then drag the Bits _ Bops Executable (it should have a Black box icon) into the Terminal

6.) Drag the .riq into the terminal

7.) Press enter 

Done! It should open up

# Windows

On Windows, you have a few ways to load a custom level.

1. You can drag an .riq file onto the Bits & Bops.exe.
2. You can launch the game normally, and on the disclaimer screen, press Ctrl+M. This will open an "open" dialog with which you can select your .riq file.
3. You can right click an .riq, select "Open as...", then in the next dialog, manually select Bits & Bops.exe as the default app to open .riq files. You will be able to double click .riq files to open them with Bits & Bops from now on.
4. You can also do the terminal trick from above, depending on your terminal program. If there is not a space after the path to your Bits & Bops.exe, you need to manually add one before dragging in your .riq file. Alternatively, if you are familiar with the command line, simply pass the .riq file's path as the first parameter for Bits & Bops.exe.

If your game is the Steam version, Steam may intercept the launch and ask whether you would like to launch the game with some parameter. The parameter should simply be the path to your .riq file. Click "Continue" and the game will launch.
